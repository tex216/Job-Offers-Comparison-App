# Extra Requirements

**Author**: Team 109

## 1. Security
Our app for a user should be secure, which includes the information security and storage security. Both current job details and job offers from the use's input should be securely stored in the database of our product.

## 2. Accuracy
Our app should have accurate returned results for a user. When a user adjust the comparison settings and compare job offers, our product should rank jobs based on a mathematic formula accurately by using the integer weight assigned from the user.

## 3. Usability
Our app should has a good use-experience for a user, which includes a concise and clear UI design, a reliable return result, and a good inteaction with the user's input.

## 4. Reusability
Our app should be reusable for a user, the database of our product should well-store all the information for every user, and it should response and return the same result whenever a user reuse the product in the future. 

## 5. Maintainability
Our app should be maintainable for developers. It should be accessible for them to maintain and update the database of the product if necessary.

## 6. Extensibility
Our app should be extensible for the addition of new functionality or through modification of existing functionality and without impairing existing system functions. For example, currently a user is allowed to compare two jobs, but more will be allowed if necessary.
