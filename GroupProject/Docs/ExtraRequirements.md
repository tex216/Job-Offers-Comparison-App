# Extra Requirements

**Author**: Team 109

## 1. Accuracy
Our app should have accurate returned results for the user. For instance, after the user adjust the comparison settings and press the `COMPARE JOB OFFERS` button, our product should rank jobs and return a job list correctly based on a mathematic formula accurately by using the integer weight assigned from the user.

## 2. Usability
Our app should has a good use-experience for the user, it includes a concise and clear UI design, a reliable return result, and a good inteaction with the user's input. For example, the user will be allowed to choose an operation from four options on the Main Menu of our app: `ENTER/EDIT CURRENT JOB`; `ENTER JOB OFFERS`; `ADJUST COMPARISON SETTINGS`; `COMPARE JOB OFFERS`.

## 3. Reusability
Our app should be reusable for a user, the database of our product should well-store all the information for every user, and it should response and return the same result whenever a user reuse the product in the future. For instance, our app employed SQLite database in the Room environment that should keep all the record from the user's input and will be avaialable anytime to reponse a use's query.    

## 4. Maintainability
Our app should be maintainable for developers. It should be accessible for developers to maintain the application including the user interface, functions, and the database, etc. For example, developers should be allowed to maximize the app's useful life and correct any defects and errors of the application in the first time when they occur. 

## 5. Extensibility
Our app should be extensible for the addition of new functionality or through modification of existing functionality and without impairing existing system functions. For instance, currently, the user is only allowed to compare two jobs, but more should be allowed if necessary via modifying corrsponding functions.
